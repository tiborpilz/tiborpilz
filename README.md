title: "Hi There! I'm Tibor Pilz"
---

I'm a fullstack developer working at the IU - International University of Applied Science.

I specialize in web development, using Typescript as my main language for both front-end and back-end projects.
I also have worked on devops tasks, using tools like GitLab CI/CD, Kubernetes, Terraform, Argo CD, and Helm, and have worked on automated load testing using K6.
I'm always learning and trying out new technologies, and I love working on dynamic, user-friendly web applications.

# Nix-Based system setup
I've recently migrated all my dotfiles and system configurations to a Nix/NixOS based setup, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/tiborpilz/nixos).

# Self-Hosting
I self-host some services on Hetzner Cloud, using Terragrunt, the Rancher Kubernetes Engine and ArgoCD, with [this repository](https://github.com/tiborpilz/infrastructure) acting as the GitOps single source of truth.
