# Hi there! I'm Tibor Pilz

I'm a fullstack developer working at IU - International University of Applied Science.
I specialize in web development, using Typescript as my main language for both front-end and back-end projects.
I also have worked on devops tasks, using tools like GitLab CI/CD, Kubernetes, Terraform, Argo CD, and Helm, and have worked on automated load testing using K6.
I'm always learning and trying out new technologies, and I love working on dynamic, user-friendly web applications.
