# Nix-Based system setup
I've recently migrated all my dotfiles and system configurations to a Nix/NixOS based setup, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/tiborpilz/nixos).

# Self-Hosting
I self-host some services on Hetzner Cloud, using Terragrunt, the Rancher Kubernetes Engine and ArgoCD, with [this repository](https://github.com/tiborpilz/infrastructure) acting as the GitOps single source of truth.
